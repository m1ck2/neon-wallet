Setup:
  - `yarn install` - Installing node dependencies

### Support

A gentle reminder, github issues is meant to be used by developers for maintaining and improving the codebase, and is not the proper location for support issues. Questions such as

- *"Why can't I log in?"*
- *"I lost my private key, is there anyway to recover it?"*
- *"Why is my balance not showing?"*

should be asked in proper support channels such as the [NEO subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/NEO/), or the official [NEO slack](https://neosmarteconomy.slack.com). You should also check the list of [frequently asked questions (FAQ)](https://github.com/CityOfZion/awesome-neo/blob/master/resources/faq.md) to see if your question has been answered there already.
